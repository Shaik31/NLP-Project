 In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify the sentiment of text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. I utilized techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and embedding methods like Word2Vec to process the text. The model was trained using a labeled dataset, achieving a high accuracy rate in sentiment classification. This project provided valuable insights into public sentiment trends and showcased the effectiveness of NLP in understanding textual data. The results can be applied in areas like customer feedback analysis and social media monitoring.
